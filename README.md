# Open Source Microscope Mk 1 (OS-M Mk 1)

Welcome! This is the GitHub repository for OS-M Mk 1. You'll find useful hardware plans and software in this repository.

## Overview
State-of-the-art optical microscopes cost thousands of dollars, posing challenges to third world hospitals and interested students. Additionally, there is a lot of electronic waste with the release of new consumer electronics, leading to rare earth metals leaching into the surrounding environment, dealing serious damage to plants, wildlife and eventually, us. The overall goal of this project was to make a cheap, open source microscope out of upcycled DVD drives (e-Waste) and hobby electronics, to address these issues.

Optical drives are designed to be very precise, in order to read very small spaces on DVDs to "read" data. There is an objective lens (essentially a ball lens) to change the angle of the laser, and a very precise stepper motor to slowly change the position of the laser assembly to read different parts of the DVD. These principles were applied to modern microscopy in order to construct a microscope for a couple hundred dollars, as opposed to thousands. Such a prototype was constructed, and samples were placed to view magnified images to test the viability of the microscope. After completion, all instructions and software were uploaded here for cloning and use around the world.

## Who We Are
We are a group of open-source technologists. This project was done as a part of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory ASPIRE Internship, by Aaban and Imaad Syed (interns), under the mentorship of Dr. Lafe Spietz (JHU APL) and Dr. Aric Sanders (NIST). Contributors on this repository are Dr. Aric Sanders, Dr. Lafe Spietz, Aaban Syed and Imaad Syed. This will remain active, as we make improvements and release more instructional documents.

## Prerequisites
In terms of hardware, an Arduino (Uno or other variants) and Raspberry Pi with a PiCamera are all required for this device to function properly. Additionally, 3 optical drives are needed. Cardboard, a hobby knife, soldering iron and hot glue are also needed for construction.

In terms of software, at least Arduino IDE version 1.8.13 (download: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) and Python 2.7 (download: https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) are needed for smooth operation. These are free to install.

## How to Use
View the Instructions Doc in the Documents folder and download software from the software folder. This is open source, so it is meant to be shared and cloned! Feel free to fork this repository, improve and share!

## Other Useful Files & Links
In the Documents folder, there are some documents that are useful for designing an optical microscope with an OPU lens. This is most useful for anyone trying to develop their own prototype, as this provides the focal length and other properties of the OPU lens, as well as mounting and imaging distances.
